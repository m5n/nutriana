Clarification of foreign key relationships is needed as the textual description of "this table links to that table" does not specify direction and sometimes refers to tables that do not hold the unique key. Here are the tables that define the keys that can be linked to (T.k means anywhere column k is used, it must relate back to T.k as a foreign key, except for table T itself):
- DATA_SRC.DataSrc_ID
- DERIV_CD.Deriv_Cd
- FD_GROUP.FdGrp_Cd
- FOOD_DES.NDB_No (also used for Ref_NDB_No)
- LANGDESC.Factor_Code
- NUTR_DEF.Nutr_No
- SRC_CD.Src_Cd


Modifications made that were missing or incorrect in the data description file ./data/sr27_doc.pdf:

FOOTNOTE table
- (MySQL) convert empty string Nutr_No values to null to avoid foreign key error added on FOOTNOTE table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 387: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_48'>,
    CONSTRAINT `#sql-36d3_48_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`Nutr_No`) REFERENCES `NUTR_DEF` (`Nutr_No`))
  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table FOOTNOTE add foreign key (Nutr_No) references NUTR_DEF(Nutr_No)
  + "select distinct Nutr_No from FOOTNOTE order by Nutr_No" reveals there's an empty value, which the NUTR_DEF table does not contain

NUT_DATA table
- (MySQL) convert empty string Deriv_Cd values to null to avoid foreign key error added on NUT_DATA table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 368: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_44'>,
    CONSTRAINT `#sql-36d3_44_ibfk_4` FOREIGN KEY (`Deriv_Cd`) REFERENCES `DERIV_CD` (`Deriv_Cd`))
  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table NUT_DATA add foreign key (Deriv_Cd) references DERIV_CD(Deriv_Cd)
  + "select distinct DERIV_CD from NUT_DATA order by DERIV_CD" reveals there's an empty value, which the DERIV_CD table does not contain
- (MySQL) convert empty string Ref_NDB_No values to null to avoid foreign key error added on NUT_DATA table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 382: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_47'>,
    CONSTRAINT `#sql-36d3_47_ibfk_5` FOREIGN KEY (`Ref_NDB_No`) REFERENCES `FOOD_DES` (`NDB_No`))
  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table NUT_DATA add foreign key (Ref_NDB_No) references FOOD_DES(NDB_No)
  + "select distinct Ref_NDB_No from NUT_DATA order by Ref_NDB_No" reveals there's an empty value, which the FOOD_DES table does not contain

NUTR_DEF table
- NUTR_DEF.txt contains non-ASCII characters (the mcg symbol). This is not corrected, so the actual value in the DB may not be the right character.
